  # Why: electron-updater (src/main/updater.ts) handles in-place updates by
  # writing a new Orca.app into /Applications. Marking the cask auto_updates
  # tells Homebrew not to compete with the in-app updater — `brew upgrade`
  # becomes a no-op unless the user passes --greedy, and brew's version
  # metadata stays aligned with whatever the app has swapped itself to.

  # Why: Orca writes user data under ~/.orca (worktrees, agent state) and
  # Electron's standard userData directories. Zap removes everything the app
  # creates during normal use so `brew uninstall --zap` is a clean slate.
