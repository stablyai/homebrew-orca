  # Why: expose the bundled `orca` CLI on PATH at install time (Homebrew symlinks
  # this into its already-on-PATH bin dir). Without it, the CLI is only registered
  # by the in-app "Install CLI" action, which a headless host can never trigger —
  # so `orca serve` on a server would be unreachable from the shell. The shim
  # resolves the real app by walking symlinks, so the Homebrew symlink works.

  # Why: Orca writes user data under ~/.orca (worktrees, agent state) and
  # Electron's standard userData directories. Zap removes everything the app
  # creates during normal use so `brew uninstall --zap` is a clean slate.
