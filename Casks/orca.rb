  # Why: electron-updater (src/main/updater.ts) handles in-place updates by
  # writing a new Orca.app into /Applications. Marking the cask auto_updates
  # tells Homebrew not to compete with the in-app updater — `brew upgrade`
  # becomes a no-op unless the user passes --greedy, and brew's version
  # metadata stays aligned with whatever the app has swapped itself to.

  # Why: expose the bundled `orca` CLI on PATH at install time (Homebrew symlinks
  # this into its already-on-PATH bin dir). Without it, the CLI is only registered
  # by the in-app "Install CLI" action, which a headless host can never trigger —
  # so `orca serve` on a server would be unreachable from the shell. The shim
  # resolves the real app by walking symlinks, so the Homebrew symlink works.
  binary "#{appdir}/Orca.app/Contents/Resources/bin/orca"

  # Why: Orca writes user data under ~/.orca (worktrees, agent state) and
  # Electron's standard userData directories. Zap removes everything the app
  # creates during normal use so `brew uninstall --zap` is a clean slate.
